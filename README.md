Have an idea? There are separate opportunities from the bi-weekly gatherings to conduct collaborative field research with the [M3 organization](https://github.com/M3-org) by opening issues to form your proposal.

### Previous Meets

#### M3 1.0

M3 used to meet every other week on Sundays at 6pm PST in Mozilla Hubs. Each M3 meet aimed to have a full write-up along with the archived agenda, full livestream VOD, clips of individual lightning talks and discussions, images taken in Hubs, and Hubs text log from Discord.

#### M3 2.0

Currently hosting twitter spaces with hackmds open for taking notes. Twitter spaces offers lightest lift and widest reach compared to meeting and promoting a virtual world meetup with livestream. People who help receive a POAP.

### Composability Panel

The first episode of a web series to bring web3 and VR developers to talk about building the Metaverse. The topic of this episode is about composability and features [@bai](https://twitter.com/bai0) (JanusXR), [@webmixedreality](https://twitter.com/webmixedreality) (Webaverse), [@toxsam](https://twitter.com/toxsam) (Polygonal Mind / Cryptoavatars), and [@META_DREAMER](https://twitter.com/META_DREAMER) (Metafactory). The show is recorded inside of a 3D scan of the Internet Archive HQ in SF interior.

### Convergence Panel

Artists are most definitely metaverse makers. Superrare held an art show in VRChat called Atlantis where giant 3D tokenized pieces were on display in an immersive underwater world. There was a side event connected to the main gallery which took you to a big gallery space with wine and cheese. Further down the hall, the space opened up to a virtual production studio set modeled after Christies auction house for a panel discussion about cryptoart and VR.

### Virtual Market 4 Field Trip

We return to [Virtual Market](https://twitter.com/Virtual_Market_) 6 months after Vket3 which had 600 visitors drew 700k visitors to 14 worlds. Since then, Vket4 has grown to 1400 exhibitors across 43 worlds and has earned the title of the world's largest virtual expo. Our group explored these worlds while taking virtual photography, sampling AR overlays, and discussing topics about the virtual economy for UGC and avatar creations.

### Tim Sweeney Open Metaverse

We've transcribed Tim Sweeney's epic talk from SIGGRAPH 2019, THRIVE: Foundational Principles & Technologies for the Metaverse, and timestamped the interesting parts for discussion. Currently in progress!

### Virtual World Economy Panel

We've gathered an incredible cast of lead developers building VR platforms to discuss virtual economies. How can creative people make a living inside these worlds? What ingredients are missing to catalyze a thriving user-generated content economy? What's the landscape look like? How can startups compete with big tech? 

![](https://i.imgur.com/wNqTzGW.jpg)

Tune in to hear about what's around the corner and what excites these veteran VR developers in this riveting discussion filmed inside a virtual reality studio!

### Virtual Market 3 Field Trip

[Virtual Market](https://v-market.work) is the biggest social VR convention that takes place in [VRChat](https://vrchat.net) and drew over 125,000 visitors during the Spring festival. Visitors can freely look, try on, and purchase 3D avatars and models displayed in themed worlds made entirely with user-generated content.

![](https://i.imgur.com/5Wl4e99.jpg)

The [M3 org](https://github.com/M3-org/schedule) went on a field trip to explore Virtual Market 3 and further discuss ideas around content discovery and marketplaces.

### Traversing Disparate Virtual Worlds

The [M3 org](https://github.com/M3-org) did a field test to observe what the current state of hopping between multiple social VR universes looks like 5 years after a [Metaversing article](https://metaversing.com/2014/05/11/travelling-between-unrelated-virtual-worlds/) describes the theory.

>"Instead of building one large Metaverse and splitting it into pieces, as has been done before, I looked at a different solution. How do we start with a bunch of unrelated pieces of software and combine them together to form a larger Metaverse? ... There are different authors, languages, graphics libraries, and more. If you wanted to create a way for players (avatars) to actually move between them, how could it be done? How would you move from JanusVR to Minecraft? How do you walk from Minecraft into VRChat?" - [*Traveling Between Unrelated Virtual Worlds*](https://metaversing.com/2014/05/11/travelling-between-unrelated-virtual-worlds/) by [Atari_Historian](https://www.reddit.com/user/Atari_Historian/)

![Traveling Between](https://i.imgur.com/BXjUHDZ.jpg)

 We also discussed questions about these worlds like what they were made with, who created the content, how easy was it, what tools they were using, and more.
